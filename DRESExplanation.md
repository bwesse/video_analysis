# I try to explain how to connect to the DRES server as the given instructions are very unclear

### 1. step
Clone this git rep https://github.com/dres-dev/DRES.git

### 2. step 
Follow the steps in the setup explanation, but before you can do the last step you have to move the Keystore.jks file to the same bin folder, where you are supposed to run the backend script. After that you should be connected to DRES and are able to write commands to the server.

### 3. step
If this worked fine, we now need to find out how the login function call works.
We are supposed to look at the examples given at https://github.com/dres-dev/Client-Examples

But here is where I dont know what to do anymore. Like should we simply rewrite the java client example to fit our credentials and stuff and then just run the client script?
Also even tho I did the setup as shown in the Java example, VS code doesnt recognize any of the APIblablabla functions and packages used. 

### Please do these steps and try to somehow get it done
