get the image embedding from clip and store it to the database.
clip can create embeddings for images and fo text. 
figure out how to save the em to the database - one the img embedding itself, one for the description and one concatenated versioon. 
whats the best way to store this embedding to then be able to do similaririty search
probably a vector and then do cosine siilarity -> see similarity_utils

get the saving to work on a daatabse with 5 images see smalltestdb

implement the search query in the gui. 

take the input image let it run through the steps and compare its embedding ot the database. 


possible addition
use yolo to label objects of interest in each image to enable wcategoriy filtering.
