# Conda Environment Setup for Video Analysis Project

This document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a Conda environment for your video analysis project. It includes installing necessary libraries, troubleshooting, and verification steps.

## Step 1: Install Anaconda

1. Download and install Anaconda from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
2. Add Anaconda to your system's PATH during installation.

## Step 2: Create a Conda Environment

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or Command Prompt.
2. Create a new Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n video_analysis_env python=3.8
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate video_analysis_env
   ```

## Step 3: Install Required Packages

1. Install specific versions of the required packages to ensure compatibility:
   ```bash
   conda install numpy=1.19.5
   conda install tensorflow=2.4.1
   conda install pandas=1.2.3
   conda install -c conda-forge opencv
   conda install scikit-learn
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c pytorch
   conda install sqlite
   conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg
   ```

## Step 4: Configure VSCode to Use Conda Environment

1. Open VSCode.
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
3. Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select the interpreter for the `video_analysis_env` environment.
4. Add the following settings to the VSCode settings JSON file (`settings.json`):
   ```json
        {
            "redhat.telemetry.enabled": false,
            "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
            "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
                "PATH": "C:\\Users\\benwe\\Anaconda3;C:\\Users\\benwe\\Anaconda3\\Scripts;C:\\Users\\benwe\\Anaconda3\\Library\\bin;%PATH%"
            },
            "python.condaPath": "C:\\Users\\benwe\\Anaconda3\\Scripts\\conda.exe"
        }
        

   ```
   Replace `benwe` with your actual username.

## Step 5: Verify Installation

Create a Python script named `env_check.py` to check if all packages are installed correctly.

Run the verification script:
```bash
python env_check.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `conda` Command Not Recognized

**Solution**: Add Anaconda to your system's PATH.

1. Open the Start menu, search for "Environment Variables", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
2. In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
3. Find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and select it. Click "Edit".
4. Add the following paths:
   ```plaintext
   C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Anaconda3
   C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Anaconda3\Scripts
   C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Anaconda3\Library\bin
   ```

### Issue: NumPy Version Conflict

**Error**: `ImportError: this version of pandas is incompatible with numpy < 1.20.3`

**Solution**: Downgrade or upgrade NumPy to a compatible version.

1. To downgrade NumPy (for TensorFlow compatibility):
   ```bash
   conda install numpy=1.19.5
   ```

2. To upgrade NumPy (for Pandas compatibility):
   ```bash
   conda install numpy>=1.20.3
   ```

3. Find compatible versions for all packages and install them accordingly.

## Summary

By following these steps, you can set up a Conda environment with all necessary libraries and ensure they are correctly installed and configured. Use the verification script to confirm that everything is working as expected.
